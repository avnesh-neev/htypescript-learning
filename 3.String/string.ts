/*
@Topic: String
@Description: Another fundamental part of creating programs in JavaScript for webpages 
		and servers alike is working with textual data. 
		As in other languages, we use the type 'string' to refer to these textual datatypes. 
		Just like JavaScript, TypeScript also uses the double quote (") or 
		single quote (') to surround string data.
